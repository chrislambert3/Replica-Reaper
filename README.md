## Overview

Currently, checking your computer for duplicate files without the help of third-party software is
tedious and inefficient. Users are required to manually open their file manager, start a search
for files with names that include "(1)" or "(2)", and filter through an overwhelming amount of
unrelated files. Even once a duplicate file is identified, the user must manually move this file
to their recycling/trash bin on their device. This is a time consuming task that could take days
depending on the size and clutter of the file system.
Replica Reaper eliminates the tedious and inefficiency of this by completely automating the
entire process. It detects and removes duplicate files in a timely manner, efficiently. Unlike many
other existing solutions that simply match filenames, or advanced duplicate detection being locked
behind paywalls, Replica Reaper provides a robust and accessible solution for users. Beyond
the basic file system cleanup feature, the software will also prevent users from unintentionally
downloading duplicate files, creating a solution that will solve the problem for good.
